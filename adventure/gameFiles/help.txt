Useful commands:

look -> description of your surroundings
go left/right/back/forward/north/east/south/west -> moving to wanted direction
take item -> taking things from room
inventory -> checking what objects you are carring
put item -> putting things from your inventory

restart -> restarting game without saving the state

Good luck!
